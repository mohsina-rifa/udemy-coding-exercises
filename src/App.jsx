/*
Your task is to make the CourseGoal component reusable / configurable. It should accept a "title" and a "description" input and output the received data between the <h2> (title) and <p> (description) tags.

The App component should then render at least two instances of the CourseGoal component.

One of those CourseGoal components must receive a title of "Learn React" and a description of "In-depth". The other titles and descriptions are entirely up to you.
